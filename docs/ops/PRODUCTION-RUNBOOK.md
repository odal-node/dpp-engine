# Production Runbook — running Odal Node for real operators

**Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Grounded in:** `docker/docker-compose.yml` (the `odal up` stack), `NodeConfig::from_env()` (`dpp-node/src/config.rs`), the trust-mode boot guard, the registry outbox, the signed ruleset channel.
**Substrate decision this encodes:** ADR-005 (strict single-tenant node) + ADR-007 (one plain dedicated VM per operator; no k8s, no Firecracker until managed-operator count forces it).

## 0. What "production" means today — three tiers, two blockers (read first)

| Tier | Profile | What it honestly claims | Available |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 Pilot-grade** | default (`NODE_PROFILE` unset) | Full lifecycle, signed + verified passports, hash-chained audit, outbox-durable registry intent; **trust ports run Ghost and say so** in `/health.trust_mode` | **Now** |
| **T2 Sealed-grade** | `NODE_PROFILE=production` | Everything above + real qualified seals (QTSP via CSC) | After the seal adapter is wired |
| **T3 Registry-grade** | `NODE_PROFILE=production` | + real EU registry registration | After the Commission publishes its registry spec |

**Blocker A — deliberate:** `NODE_PROFILE=production` **refuses to boot** while seal/registry resolve to Ghost (the honesty invariant working as designed). So every deployment today is **T1 by definition**: run the default profile, point monitoring at `/health`, and make no sealed/registered claims. Do not weaken the guard to "get to production" — the guard *is* the product's credibility.

**Blocker B — operational:** engine `main` now pins **core 0.4.0, which is unpublished** (0.3.0 is the latest on crates.io). The compose `pull` and plain `--build` modes resolve crates.io and **will fail**. Until 0.4.0 is published: build with the local-core overlay (`--build` + `-f docker/docker-compose.local.yml`, i.e. `just up-local`) and record the image digest you deployed. **Before the first external operator deploy: publish core 0.4.0** — your own release rule (CI/release = crates.io) exists precisely so a deploy is reproducible from public sources.

## 1. Reference topology — one VM per operator, and why it's the efficient answer

```
            Internet
               │ :443 (TLS)
        ┌──────▼──────┐          One VM = one operator (ADR-005 boundary)
        │ Caddy proxy │          Hetzner/OVH-class, EU region, ~€10–25/mo [E]
        └──┬───────┬──┘          2 vCPU / 4 GB / 40 GB is ample [E]
   api.<op-domain> dpp.<op-domain>
           │           │
     ┌─────▼───┐ ┌─────▼─────┐   docker compose (the shipped stack):
     │ dpp-node│ │dpp-resolver│  postgres:17 · redis · nats · node · resolver
     │  :8000  │ │   :8003   │   volumes: pg-data · node-data(keystore!) ·
     └────┬────┘ └───────────┘            node-plugins · redis · nats
          └── postgres · nats · redis (internal only, no host ports)
```

**Why this beats the alternatives (the "why" you asked for):**
- **It matches the sealed architecture.** ADR-005 made the node strictly single-tenant; an orchestrator's whole value is multiplexing tenants onto shared machines — the thing you deliberately forbid. One VM per operator makes the marketing sentence ("your own isolated node, zero shared data paths") *physically true* with zero additional code.
- **It's the smallest ops surface a solo operator can carry.** The compose stack already exists and is `odal up`; systemd + docker + caddy is knowledge you keep for a decade. Kubernetes would add a control plane to operate, YAML to drift, and failure modes you'd learn during an incident — an ops tax with no payer (your BLUEPRINT lists it Post-MVP; correct).
- **It prices correctly.** Managed operation is sold cost-plus on the Skopje cost base (ADR-002/C7). A ~€15/mo VM per operator keeps the unit economics legible and the margin honest. PaaS (Fly/Render/Heroku-class) triples the unit cost, complicates the EU-data-residency story, and hides the disk your keystore lives on.
- **It scales by addition, not redesign.** Operator #2 = second VM + same compose + 30 minutes. The review trigger (ADR-007: >5 managed operators or a provisioning SLA) is the *earliest* point automation pays for itself.
- **Failure isolation is absolute.** One operator's disk filling cannot touch another operator. For a compliance product, blast-radius honesty is a feature you can sell.

## 2. Bring-up, step by step (T1 pilot-grade)

**2.1 DNS + naming (decide once per operator).** Two hostnames on the *operator's* domain (the "your DID, our ops" posture): `api.<operator-domain>` → node (private API, operator-only), `dpp.<operator-domain>` (or `id.`) → resolver (public QR target). `DID_WEB_BASE_URL` **must equal the public HTTPS origin that serves `/.well-known/did.json`** — the DID document route the node exposes; if the DID is `did:web:api.<operator-domain>`, then `https://api.<operator-domain>/.well-known/did.json` must resolve through the proxy. Changing this later invalidates the DID — decide before first publish.

**2.2 VM hardening (30 min, once per VM).** SSH keys only (`PasswordAuthentication no`); `ufw`: allow 22+443 (and 80 for ACME), deny rest; `fail2ban`; unattended security upgrades; separate non-root user with docker group. **Change the compose port mappings to loopback** — `127.0.0.1:8001:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8003:8003` — so node/resolver are reachable only via Caddy. [The shipped compose maps to all interfaces; this one-line change per service is the single most important hardening step.]

**2.3 TLS proxy.** Caddy (host package or a fourth compose service), minimal config:
```
api.<operator-domain> {  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8001 }
dpp.<operator-domain> {  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8003 }
```
Auto-HTTPS, zero certificate ops. (Traefik equivalent if preferred; Caddy is less config.)

**2.4 The `.env` (the whole contract).** From `NodeConfig::from_env()` + compose + the trust-mode/ruleset config — every name below is real:

| Var | Req | Value guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_POSTGRES_PASS` / `DATABASE_APP_PASS` | ✔ | 32+ random chars each; compose fails closed without them |
| `KEY_STORE_PASSPHRASE` | ✔ | Generated, stored in the password manager **and** printed/sealed offline (§4 custody); loss = loss of signing identity |
| `DID_WEB_BASE_URL` | ✔ | `https://api.<operator-domain>` (see 2.1) |
| `KEY_STORE_PATH` | ✔ (compose pins it) | Leave as compose sets it — on the `node-data` volume; the inline warning about the throwaway layer is real |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | opt | Set for bootstrap, then prefer API keys; rotate after onboarding |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | opt | The dashboard origin only, when it exists |
| `NATS_URL` | opt | Compose provides it; unset ⇒ NoOp bus (acceptable for pilot if you drop the service) |
| `METRICS_ADDR` | opt | `127.0.0.1:9464` — never public (RT2-7) |
| `PLUGINS_DIR` | ✔ (compose: `/plugins`) | Mount the sector `.wasm` files into the `node-plugins` volume |
| `RULESET_BUNDLE_PATH` + `RULESET_PUBLISHER_PUBKEY` | opt | Wire when the first Compliance Current bundle ships; bad bundle ⇒ last-good + alarm |
| `NODE_PROFILE` | opt | **Leave unset** (T1). Set `production` only at T2 — it will refuse ghosts, correctly |
| `DATABASE_MIGRATE_URL` | opt | Keep for pilot (idempotent sqlx migrations at boot); the least-privilege upgrade (external `just migrate`, app role only at runtime) is a later hardening |
| `EU_REGISTRY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `ARCHIVE_S3_BUCKET`… | opt | T3 / archive tier — leave unset until real |
| `ODAL_VERSION` | ✔ | **Pin a tag/digest. Never `latest` in production.** Same for the `postgres:17` image (pin digest — the compose header says so itself) |

`chmod 600 .env`; it is a secret.

**2.5 First boot.** `docker compose up -d` (with the local-core overlay until Blocker B clears) → postgres init runs `bootstrap.sql` (creates `odal_app`) → node applies `ops/pg` migrations via `DATABASE_MIGRATE_URL` → healthchecks green.

**2.6 Go-live smoke (the gate — do not skip).** (1) `/health` shows expected `profile`, `trust_mode` per port, `ruleset.version`; (2) create → publish a test passport via API key; (3) resolve it: JSON *and* HTML on `dpp.<operator-domain>`, signature verifies (fail-closed path); (4) scan the QR from a phone on mobile data (not the VM's network); (5) tamper test: flip a field in `psql` → resolver returns 409; (6) `verify_chain` on the audit trail returns intact; (7) kill the node mid-publish, restart → outbox row survives (the chaos case, once per deployment). Record all seven in the operator's onboarding record — this doubles as your SLA evidence baseline.

## 3. Day-2 operations

**Backups — the only thing that can actually kill you.** Nightly `pg_dump -Fc` + copy of `keystore.enc` (it's on `node-data`) → **off-VM** object storage (EU region, versioned bucket, 30-day retention) — a 10-line cron script; the passphrase is *not* stored beside the dump. Redis/NATS are cache/replayable — exclude. **Monthly restore drill** on a scratch VM: restore dump + keystore → boot → old passport still resolves + verifies; target <1h (the S-4 gate). An untested backup is a hypothesis.

**Monitoring (pilot-appropriate, ~€0).** External uptime probe (UptimeRobot-class free tier) on `https://dpp.<domain>/health`-equivalent public route + the resolver of a known passport; assert not just 200 but the JSON: expected `trust_mode` values — **a config regression that silently flips a port's trust tier must page you** (that's your honesty invariant, monitored). On-VM: Prometheus scrape of `127.0.0.1:9464` or, simpler for one VM, a cron that greps the metrics endpoint and mails on: `signing_failures_total > 0`, `registry_outbox_stalled > 0`, `ruleset_load_failures_total > 0`, disk >80%. Full Grafana/Loki stack is H3 — do not build it for one operator.

**Upgrades — the ritual.** (1) backup first; (2) bump the pinned `ODAL_VERSION` on the **staging** VM (your own demo VM is staging), run §2.6 smoke; (3) same on prod; (4) migrations apply at boot (forward-only — **rollback = restore from backup**, so step 1 is the rollback plan); (5) post-deploy: §2.6 items 1–3 minimum + diff `/health.ruleset.version`. Log every upgrade in the operator record (BUILD-LOG habit, operator-facing).

**Key rotation — ⚠️ check before you ever rotate.** The identity service supports rotation, but the audit trail (ONBOARDING ticket #3, W-2) flagged that JWS verification may resolve only the primary key — **verify the `kid`-based verification fix has landed and has a green rotation test before rotating a production operator's key**; otherwise rotation can break verification of previously published passports. Until verified: don't rotate except on suspicion of compromise, and then with a full re-verify sweep. [Status of that fix: unverified as of this runbook — confirm in `dpp-crypto`/resolver tests.]

**Key custody (managed mode).** Two documented modes, chosen per contract: (a) Odal-held passphrase (full managed; passphrase in your vault + sealed offline copy), or (b) operator-held (they enter it at provisioning; you cannot sign without them — the deepest sovereignty tier). Either way the *custody statement* is part of the managed contract (pack 04 §3.7).

## 4. Efficiency summary (the direct answer)

The most efficient production shape for Odal today is **the shipped compose stack, one dedicated EU VM per operator, loopback-bound services behind Caddy, pinned image versions, nightly off-VM backups with a monthly restore drill, and `/health`-asserting monitoring** — because it is the only shape that simultaneously (a) keeps ADR-005's isolation claim physically true, (b) adds zero new operational technology for a solo operator, (c) keeps unit cost at cost-plus-priceable ~€15–25/mo [E], (d) already exists in the repo (`odal up`), and (e) leaves the honesty invariant intact — a "production" that can't lie about its trust tier. Efficiency here is not throughput (a single node trivially serves pilot loads — sub-20ms resolver SLAs are an H3 concern); it is **founder-hours per operator per month**, and this shape minimizes exactly that.

**Do-next order:** publish core 0.4.0 → provision your own demo VM as the permanent staging environment (§2 end-to-end, once, for yourself) → then Amor's VM is a 30-minute repeat with a filled-in checklist.
